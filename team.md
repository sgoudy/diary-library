# Welcome to Team 3

Let us introduce ourselves:

### Christopher Keers

Hello everyone! My names Christopher, but I often go by Chris. I'm a software developer by trade and I'm currently working part time as a developer and as an adjunct professor. I love vanilla code! I struggle with frameworks like React and Angular.

### Shelby Goudy

Hi! I'm Shelby, callsign "EVA". Recently transitioned to tech from aviation and it's AWESOME. Why did no one tell me this? I love logic. I'm glad Chris likes vanilla code, same here. React is more familiar to me because I have a full-stack degree but I definitely need this practice.

### Andrew Acord-Serventi

Hey everyone! My name is Marcus, but everyone calls me by my middle name, Andrew. Outside of Boston University, I have little to no programming experience (but 10 years of HR and military experience prior to BU). Since I've started programming however, I've found my true passion and calling. I love to program! But I'm glad I have more experienced team members as I know very little real-world programming (learning javascript this weekend!).

### Priyanka Gnanasekaran

Hello everyone! I'm Priyanka, preferred name Priya. I worked as a full stack developer in _CATERPILLAR, India_ and as a Teacher for 3 years. Plan to switch gears into IT as Software Developer after completing Masters degree in Boston University. I'm studious and enjoy programming. Thanks to BU for giving me an opportunity to meet these awesome team members. Cheers everyone!!

### Ashley Nguyen

```
const greetings = (name: string) => {
    alert(`Hello ${name}!`)
}

greetings('team')
```

Hi! My name is Ashley Nguyen. I've been working full time as a Software Engineer for 3 years. I started as a Cybersecurity Engineer which I found to be really boring and transitioned to work in the streaming industry at Disney+! I joined a few months before the **Disney+ Launch** in Nov 2019 and it was so cool to see the intersection of software engineering and the global impact of this launch. I've worked with `JS`, `Java`, plain old `HTML`, `Python`, `AWS` and more frequently in the past 2 years with `React` and `Scala`. Although I've never worked with Angular and Vue ðŸ˜® since I've been enjoying using the newer React hooks and state management! Excited to work with this team and get more familiar with folks around the BU community!

### Alex Morgan

Hi everyone! I'm Alex Morgan. (No, not the soccer player... at the opposite end of the spectrum of athletic ability, unfortunately... If you ever want
a really low-skill tennis partner for some super non-judgemental hitting practice at a relaxed pace, that's me!)

Currently I'm working for a firm in the telecomm sector, helping to maintain the messy legacy Java/Spring Boot/Hibernate
back-end of a tool that plans fiber optic networks. Using Git and Pivotal... this class is way too much like my daytime job hah-hah!

Less familiar with Node/Express, and clueless about React, but these are things I should learn.

Hopefully you'll get a glimpse of my really cute cat on Zoom at some point.
